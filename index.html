                <p>In 1987 my mom and dad decided to have a baby who was going to come and light up the world and my mom said to herself, "Oh, how I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony.”</p>
                <p>To be honest It was not the start of my story . It was at the end of Iran-Iraq war and there was no good source for things that a family needs and I bet my parents didn’t have any plan to have a baby after five children in a village in the middle of nowhere but it happened and I was born in JAN 1988 :).</p>
                <p>After 2 months my dad passed away because of cancer and every one had to to do something to help making a living. Apart from financial problem, they were struggling with other issues as well which had a big impact on our mental and physical health. In our girls were allowed to go to primary school and tat made my sisters and other girls to give up education  because of that. Even  the teachers dared to hit students as they found us weak. </p>
                <p>When I was ten, we moved to the nearest small town and I got the opportunity to continue at secondary school.</p>
                <p>Studying was the main thing I could fill my days with. I loved sports though but it was not common for a girl to do sports especially Tekvando which I started and gave up after 4 month as mum was stopped me going .She believed that I would get hurt on my face and my body and no one in the future would marry me.I finished school and took the exam to enter to university. I  chose physics to study as I got top grade in citywide physics olympiad and I was thinking I could get somewhere after graduation?</p>
          <p>What do you think?</p>
                <p>NOOOOOOPPPP!!!!!!!!!</p>
           <p>when I graduate I had to come back to my small town where women is considered to marry and make themselves busy with kids not working.</p>
           <p>I decided to continue studying in master degree to find a better way to live. I defended my thesis in 2015 . I had chosen experimental research in nanotechnology as I was really curious to see what was happening to the material and also I had heard that job hunting opportunities in experimental field is better and I had hope to get somewhere by that.
            what do you think? Did I get somewhere?</p>
            <p>NOOOOOOPPPP!!!!!!!!!</p>
           <p>Again I came back to my town. I was staying at home and learning English, photoshop and and teaching physics privately to teenagers in close families, but I loved to work as a researcher. For that I had to travel to a bigger city which I was not allowed by my family because I was a young girl and a young girl should stay with family.</p>      
           <p>for courses I needed to travel but I could find very basic online course. In that course I learned very basic of HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL and PHP.
            I didn't make website for myself to earn money but I fell in love with coding and it was the thing that I even could entertain myself while I am learning.</p>
<p>In 2020 started learning English with ACL Islington and the time I was looking on the website to enrol for summer term I saw a post about a course with <bold>web development<bold> title.</p>
<p>And another miracle door in my life got opened</p>
